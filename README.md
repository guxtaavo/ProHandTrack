# ProHandTrack
A minimal Unity project to learn the fundamentals of **spatial tracking using QR Codes** and **Mixed Reality**, powered by the **Meta XR All-in-One SDK**.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features
* **QR Code Detection**: Recognizes physical markers in the real world to locate the prosthesis position.  
* **Prosthesis Tracking**: Updates the virtual prosthesis position in real time based on the detected QR Code.  
* **Passthrough Ready**: Combines real-world vision with virtual elements in the headset.  
* **Simple and Clean Scene**: Visualize prosthesis tracking and calibration in an easy-to-understand environment.  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
* **Unity 6 (LTS)** or newer.  
* **Android Build Support** module installed in Unity.  
* **Meta Quest 3** headset in **Developer Mode**.  
* **Meta XR All-in-One SDK** imported into the project.  
* A **QR Code**.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
This project is a hands-on guide for:
* Setting up and using the **Meta XR SDK**.  
* Reading and tracking **QR Codes** in a real-world environment.  
* Mapping the physical prosthesis position into the virtual space.
